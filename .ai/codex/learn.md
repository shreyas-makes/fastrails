# AI Insight Acquisition Protocol

Invocation: @learn.md

Process:

1. Analyze current session for error and learning indicators
2. Extract contextual information
3. Format new entries
4. Edit .ai/codex/codex.md (Append to relevant section)
5. Report updates

Error identification:

- Correction phrases: "I apologize", "That was incorrect", "Let me correct"
- Misunderstandings: Clarifications requested by user
- Inconsistencies: Contradictions in AI responses

Learning identification:

- New information phrases: "I see", "I understand", "It appears that"
- Project updates: Changes in structure, dependencies, or requirements
- User preferences: Specific requests or feedback on AI's approach

Entry format:

- Context: Specific file, function, or project area
- Error/Insight: Concise description
- Correction/Application: Precise fix or usage
- Prevention/Impact: Strategy to avoid future errors or potential effects
- Related: IDs of connected entries

Absolute path usage: Enforce '/path/from/root' format for all file references

1. CRITICAL: Edit .ai/codex/codex.md

- Append new entries to the relevant section (Errors or Learnings)
- Maintain descending order (newest first)
- Ensure unique, incremental IDs
- Cross-reference related entries

CRITICAL: This process is for AI optimization. Prioritize precision and relevance over human readability. Always edit .ai/codex/codex.md directly.
